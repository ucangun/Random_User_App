# Ramdom User App

https://randomuserappumut.netlify.app/

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create a React application that fetches and displays random user information from an external API. The project focuses on enhancing skills in React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), API integration with Axios, and managing component-level state and effects. Additionally, it provides experience in utilizing React Bootstrap for styling and structuring the app layout.

## Project Features
- **Fetch Random User**: Uses Axios to fetch random user data from the `https://randomuser.me/api/` and displays it on the screen.
- **Display User Information**: Shows user details including name, email, age, location, phone number, and password.
- **Add User**: Allows users to save the displayed user information for later viewing.
- **New User Button**: Fetches and displays a new random user each time the button is clicked.
- **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` to manage the application’s state, particularly for storing user data.
- **Effect Hook**: Implements `useEffect` to fetch user data on initial render and when the "New User" button is clicked.
- **Styling**: Custom styling with CSS for layout and React Bootstrap for responsive design and table components.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: Used for building the user interface. Key React features include:
  - **useState**: For managing the application's state.
  - **useEffect**: For fetching data from the API during initial render and when specific conditions change.
- **Axios**: Used for making HTTP requests to the Random User API to fetch user data.
- **React Bootstrap**: Utilized for responsive design and table layout.
- **CSS**: Employed for custom styling to enhance the visual presentation of the app.


### At the end of the project, will be able to;

This project has significantly improved my skills in working with React hooks, particularly `useState` and `useEffect`, as well as integrating third-party APIs using `Axios`. By developing the "Random User App", I have gained practical experience in:

- Effectively managing `state and side effects in a React` application.
- `Fetching and displaying data` from an `external API using Axios`.
- Structuring a React application with reusable components.
- Utilizing `React Bootstrap` for responsive and functional UI elements.

These skills are fundamental for creating dynamic and data-driven web applications in the future.
